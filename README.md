# -Store-Sales-data-Analysis
'Vrinda Store' Data Analysis Project

Project Details:

In this project I have cleaned Vrinda store sales data and represented the the data using pivot charts in Excel answering questions such as:

Compare the sales and orders using single chart

Which month got the highest sales and orders?

Who purchased more- men or women in 2022?

What are different order status in 2022?

List top 5 states contributing to the sales?

Relation between age and gender based on number of orders

Which channel is contributing to maximum sales?

Sales By  category ?

To conclude, I have also added slicers for Channel, categories and month for ease of access for further inspection and visualization.
