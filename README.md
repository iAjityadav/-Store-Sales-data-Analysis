'Vrinda Store' Data Analysis Project

Project Details:

In this project I have cleaned Vrinda store sales data and represented the the data using pivot charts in Excel answering questions such as:

1- Compare the sales and orders using single chart

2 - Which month got the highest sales and orders?

3 -Who purchased more- men or women in 2022?

4 - What are different order status in 2022?

5 -List top 5 states contributing to the sales?

6 -Relation between age and gender based on number of orders

7 - Which channel is contributing to maximum sales?

8 -Sales By  category ?

To conclude, I have also added slicers for Channel, categories and month for ease of access for further inspection and visualization.
